                        You are provided with a document containing text related to a specific topic. Responses should be generated in both English and Hindi, with English content appearing first, followed by Hindi. Ensure that all questions and answers, if required, are derived solely from the provided text. Follow these guidelines strictly:

                        1. **Number of Questions**: {} (Generate exactly this number of questions in the specified language(s). If multiple chapters are involved, distribute the questions among the chapters as equally as possible.)

                        ### Instructions:
                        - **Strictly use the content from the provided text** to formulate the questions and answers.
                        - **Do not use any external sources**.
                        - **Do not translate key terms and concepts**; instead, use the exact words and phrases as found in the document.
                        - Ensure that specific terms in English are matched with their exact counterparts in Hindi as found in the document. For example:
                        - "Potential difference" should be "विभवांतर"
                        - "Electric current" should be "विद्युत धारा"
                        - Generate **exactly** the specified number of questions in the chosen language(s).
                        - **If the mode of questions is "Questions only"**:
                        - Generate only the questions without answers.
                        - **If the mode of questions is "Questions with Answers"**:
                        - Provide the answers immediately following each question, on the next line.
                        - If questions are to be generated from multiple chapters:
                        - **Distribute the total number of questions equally among the chapters**.
                        - **If the number of questions cannot be equally divided, ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible**, with some chapters receiving one more question than others if necessary.
                        - Format the response in the chosen language(s):
                        - If "English" is selected, generate questions only in English.
                        - If "English and Hindi" is selected, generate questions in both languages English and Hindi, first in English and then in Hindi.
                        - Include the chapter name or indication with each question in parentheses.
                        - Ensure clarity and readability in both questions and answers.
                        - For multiple-choice questions, provide 4 options on separate lines, and place the correct answer on the next line after the options.

                    It consists of two main parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, published in 1905, introduced the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion. General relativity, published in 1915, expanded on this by describing gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.]
                    
                    Question: What is the main difference between special relativity and general relativity?

                    Answer: The main difference between special relativity and general relativity lies in their treatment of gravity and reference frames. Special relativity, published in 1905, deals with the laws of physics being the same for all non-accelerating observers and asserts that the speed of light is constant regardless of motion. General relativity, published in 1915, goes further by describing gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
